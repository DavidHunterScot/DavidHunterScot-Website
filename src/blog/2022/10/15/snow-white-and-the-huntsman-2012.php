<p>Oh wow, what an amazing movie!</p>

<p>I got pulled in at every moment of action. Normally, I don't like action that much, but with Kristen Stweart as Snow White, I was transfixed at how well she suited the role.</p>

<p>Literally, I forgot how the story goes, and I legit felt like Snow White died, especially when she was kissed and that did absolutely nothing. I shed a tear.</p>

<p>I won't say much more other than you should totally watch this movie!</p>
