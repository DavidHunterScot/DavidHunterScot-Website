Oh wow, what an amazing movie!

I got pulled in at every moment of action. Normally, I don't like action that much, but with Kristen Stweart as Snow White, I was transfixed at how well she suited the role.

Literally, I forgot how the story goes, and I legit felt like Snow White died, especially when she was kissed and that did absolutely nothing. I shed a tear.

I won't say much more other than you should totally watch this movie!
