<h2>Hello, I'm David.</h2>
<p>An internet services specialist from Ayrshire, Scotland.</p>

<p>Do you want to be able to use various internet based services, such as Shopping and Banking, Accessing Emails, Learning, or simply just Browsing the Internet, but maybe lack the know-how and need a helping hand?</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to have your own website all about you, or maybe one about your favourite hobby, or to help promote your business or charity?</p>
<p>Get in touch with me and we can chat about it, and hopefully we can be good friends too.</p>

<p>Just send me an email, and I will respond soon.</p>

<p>One more thing, if you're not doing much else right now, maybe you could check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a>?</p>

<p>For those that are technically minded, I write software for various projects. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/DavidHunterScot/Website" target="_blank">source code for this website</a> or my other projects on <a href="https://github.com/DavidHunterScot" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
