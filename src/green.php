<h2>Powered by 100% Green and Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>As humans, we have not always been good to our planet when we discovered different methods to power various things. If we don't change our ways, we will continue to damage the planet that gives us life. We will continue to pass on a bad legacy to our decendants, which we will in turn regret.</p>
<p>I pledge to do what I can to reduce and change my approach to energy usage, and help others do the same. My industry is one that requires a lot of power, and has been proven to be a massive contributor to the damage we do to our planet.</p>
<p>It therefore gives me great pleasure to announce that the infrastructure that powers my domains and websites uses 100% green and renewable energy, and other technologies that helps reduce energy usage and make things a lot cleaner and greener.</p>
<p>A few things I have implemented already are...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Utilising a <code class="highlight">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</code> that spans <code class="highlight">285+ cities</code> in <code class="highlight">100+ countries</code>, bringing the content of my websites and web-based projects closer to visitors. This reduces the amount of time content has to be downloaded to a visitor's device, meaning <code class="highlight">less network usage</code> and <code class="highlight">less bandwidth usage</code>.</li>
    <li><code class="highlight">Static websites</code> are now being <code class="highlight">built during deployment</code>, rather than for each request. This reduces server processing time and power, as the server only has to send the content back to the requester. This allows the server to handle more requests at once, requiring fewer servers for the same traffic load over standard hosting environments.</li>
    <li>Visitors to some of my websites and web-based projects will <code class="highlight">save energy</code> on the ones that have a <code class="highlight">dark color scheme</code>. Dark colors require less light to produce, effectively saving energy over brighter colors. If a web project supports this initiative, then it will either have a dark color scheme as its only color scheme, or provide a dark mode to those that enable it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over time, I will continue to do these and more to make our planet a better place for everyone today and in our future, but I cannot do it alone. Please help me by making small changes to what you do, and together we will make a world that we and our future decendants can be proud of.</p>
